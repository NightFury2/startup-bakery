          Three years ago, we launched our first product on Kickstarter:
          an expressive and modular MIDI controller for seasoned
          musicians, which is used today by many artists around the
          world.`,

        But lots of amateur musicians wanted to get their hands on it
        as well, and we felt frustrated that we couldn’t satisfy them,
        as current music software remains too complex to be
        apprehended easily. So we decided to create a new instrument
        that would enable anyone to start making music.`,
